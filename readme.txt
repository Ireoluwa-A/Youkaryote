Project Description:
‘Youkaryote’ is a simulation type game. It treats the parts of a eukaryotic cell as a city/castle 
that the player has to build, micromanage, and improve for the goal of producing protein, 
expanding and conquering the entire map. 

Project is ran by running main.py

Default cmu_cs3_graphics library needs to be installed

Useful shortcuts: 
s - Gives more info (view useful cell, hex and organelle stats)
t - super speed mode (increases speed of production to test features faster)
p - toggle game paused
r - restart game
c - cell view
m - map view

Tip & notes:
Game starts out paused, press p to unpause 
Change settings, specifically, increase size of hex map (alternatively uncomment 'easy mode defaults' in constants.py)
press t (super speed mode) to make game easier
